        <h3>#1: Segmentation Faults (Core Dumped)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          As anyone who has programmed in C knows, working with a language
          that is not memory safe can be a blessing and a curse.  One
          negative of low-level access is the segfault, which is caused
          by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location.
          Some students have dubbed recieving this common programming error
          'Taking a segfault to the face'.

        <h3>#2: Procrastination</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          The only possible thing that makes a CS lab harder is when its
          due at midnight and itâ€™s 10pm.  Being a CS major and procrastinating
          is probably a bad combination, like beans and red wine.  Most
          CS labs are time consuming to say the least, so starting the day
          they are due is definitely not a good idea.

        <h3>#3: Not Using Git</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          As a student, especially if no one else is working on your code,
          using Git can seem tedious and unneccessary.  Why learn this complicated
          new system and follow a new workflow?  Well, as anyone who has tried
          and failed at a major change and forgotten to back up their work knows,
          using Git correctly can be crucial to success.  Proper Git usage can
          save invaluable time and is a necessary skill for group work.

        <h3>#4: Getting Cooked</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          Ever tried taking two systems level programming courses in the same
          term?  Or how about saving an entire CS50 lab until the last minute?
          The term to descrive these situations, in which there is an unrealistic
          or overly difficult amount of work to be done in a short period of time,
          is 'getting cooked'.  As a CS major, it is imperative to select your
          schedule judiciously and use proper time management to avoid getting
          cooked at all costs.

        <h3>#5: Forgetting How to Code</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          What's that you say?  How could a programmer possibly forget how to
          code?  Well you're right, they probably couldn't.  The problem is
          that we had to make up some content for this tutorial and we
          ran out of ideas.
